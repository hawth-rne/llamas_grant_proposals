# Proposal for the Curve DAO Grants Council

## Objective

Use the LLamas job marketplace to source and hire an experienced dev to found a data-driven research and marketing guild that tells easy-to-digest onchain stories about the Curve ecosystem.

## Need

Some of the most interesting events in all of crypto happen on Curve. Yet, understanding these onchain moments can feel unapproachable to many — namely, newer market participants.

Clearly communicating the nuances and daily happenings of the Curve ecosystem, in a compelling way, showcases its vibrancy and will attract new participants and contributors.

Example: the data-first graphs and content supporting the crvUSD launch have made an incredibly complex system easier to understand and use.

_Feedback Give examples of how data stories will be created._

## Proposers

Hawthorne and Panda, co-founders of the LLamas ([notion.so/the-llamas](https://www.notion.so/the-llamas/0e3fa69ef54245dea74e1aa17fb86497?v=147051a45bbd41b796adedd261826c2e)), envision building a permissionless talentpool of contributors and founders within the Curve ecosystem.

We are pursuing our first grant from the Curve DAO Grants Council to build this subdao.

_Feedback This can be in the bottom._

## Progress

_Feedback This section talks about progress, but it is more of a Resume of The Llamas. And I think this could be expanded on a bit better: what did you do for the other DAOs?_

So far, the LLamas job marketplace has completed work for Reserve and a series of collaborations between zkEVM Polygon and Aave, Maker (Spark), and CoW.

We have used our platform to locate and engage driven, talented devs across multiple skillsets.

Now, the LLamas is looking to engage and direct its talent toward long-term contributions to Curve via creating a sustainable subdao.

## Planning

1. Use LLamas job marketplace to engage a dev to found the guild.
   _Feedback It would be cool if there was already someone you had in mind. Or at least: there should be somewhat of a guarantee that a dev will be found. Otherwise, the DAO might be sending money to the ether and let's say you never find any talent: then what? Perhaps a contingency plan is appropriate here._

2. LLamas will present candidates to Fiddy for approval on skillset and cultural fit.
   _Feedback Definitely can do this, but my role would probably be at most advisory._

3. Begin producing as much data-driven writing and visual content as possible in 6 months—— including how-to content to better navigate the ecosystem, in collaboration with existing efforts.
   _Feedback Instead of talking about how the work will be done, it is better to lay out a concrete plan on what will be achieved. What stories can you think of? How will you nurture the role of this data stories lead?_

4. Leverage the different skill sets of driven LLamas job market participants to tell compelling data-stories about Curve, across multiple mediums.
   _Feedback This is similar to the previous point. Better to write down a list of things you would like to achieve._

5. Place SEO-optimized content on venues that will get the most traction to onboard and attract new users.
   _Feedback This is potentially very interesting. Why do you think SEO is necessary? I know its important, but the council does not. SEO sort of comes out of nowhere in the proposal. Some context would be good._

## Documentation Management

The content and visual assets will be hosted on the Jupyter notebook or Notion, open to public contributions and updates.
_Feedback You can discuss how this could potentially be integrated to docs.curve.fi somehow. So: a public github repo that tells data stories, that anyone can do a Pull Request to, and upon merging the pull request, the story would get automatically published to (say) notebooks.curve.fi (just making it up). Explain how this would be maintained._

## Budget

10,000 USD per month for 6 months, split 75/25 between funding the guild's lead dev and the guild itself. Open to review, reworking and extension based on progress at the end of the 6 month period.

_Feedback This looks reasonable. Start small with a lead dev, expand out. But important to mention that you want to do you own bounties in here. So a full breakdown of the budget would be useful._

Payable to:

2-of-4 Multisig: [TBD]

Signers:

[TBD]

1. Hawthorne (LLamas)
2. (CurveResearch Team)
3. (Curve Team) _Feedback The less the core team's presence, the better. Eventually the DAO must mature and outgrow the core devs._
4. (future guild founder)

## Collaboration with CurveResearch Team

Upon grant approval, the team will establish a multisig with CurveResearch members. This collaboration ensures the technical accuracy and relevance of the produced content.
